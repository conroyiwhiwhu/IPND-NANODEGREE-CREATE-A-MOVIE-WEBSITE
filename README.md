# Stage 3: Create a Movie Website

In this stage, you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the project checkpoint you will create a simple movies webpage with images and trailers.

This project is a part of the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.
